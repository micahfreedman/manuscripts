This manuscript contains data from two experiments:
1. A common-garden experiment conducted in 2017 and 2018 that involved rearing monarch butterflies on various milkweed species in a greenhouse.Wild-caught butterflies from the Mariana Islands (Guam and Rota) collected in 2015.
2. The primary data collected is chromatography data representing cardenolides present in milkweed leaf tissue and monarch butterfly wing tissue. For dataset 1, these data were generated by the lead author and processed into interpretable output (.csv files) using proprietary software (Chromeleon). For dataset 2, these data were generated and processed by Dr. Mark Hunter. All analyses were conducted using the resulting .csv files. We also included a number of raw data files (in .txt form) for the purpose of demonstration.


The full repository contains the following files and directories:

**Important usage note: prior to conducting analysis, the user should unzip the folder entitled chromatograms.zip. This will create a new folder in the ./data directory that contains all of the .txt files corresponding to the raw chromatograms that will be used for visualization.
1. adult_data.csv : contains information for butterflies reared during experiment 1. Relevant column headers are as follows:
		Cat.ID - sample name
		Year - year in which butterfly was reared
		Date - date on which neonate caterpillar was added to host plant
		Usage - whether the individual host plant had been used in prior feeding trials (value = 2) or was being used for the first time (value = 1)
		Plant.ID - identity of the host plant used for rearing
		Species - species of the host plant used for rearing
		Pop - provenance of the host plant used for rearing
		GH - whether the plant was grown in greenhouse #1 (Core) or greenhosue #2 (86W)
		Group - blocking variable corresponding to plant position on greenhouse bench
		Mon.Pop - population of origin for monarchs
		Weight - mass of caterpillar after 8 days of feeding
		Pupation - date of pupation
		Eclosion - date of eclosion
		Sex - butterfly sex
		OE - level of infection with the protozoan parasite Ophryocystis elektroschirrha (OE), presented on scale from 0-5 corresponding to log10 spore counts
		maternal_family - maternal family of origin for monarchs used in trial
		sym.allo - whether the butterfly was reared on a sympatric or allopatric host plant
2. chromatograms : directory containing .txt files for raw chromatogram readout from experiment 1. Usage notes:
		Each file is named according to its corresponding sample
		Each file contains a header that includes information about injection conditions, injection time, etc.
		Relevant data begins on line 45 and includes two columns:
			Retention time (Time)
			Signal intensity (Value)
3. concatenated_cardenolides.csv : full data matrix of cardenolide peaks across all leaf and wing tissue samples from experiment 1. Columns include:
		Year - year in which sample was injected and analyzed
		Plate - identity of the 96 well plate that includes sample
		Injection - order of injection
		Sample - sample ID
		Species - corresponding milkweed species 
		Tissue - whether sample is milkweed tissue (leaf) or butterfly tissue (wing)
		Position - position within 96 well plate
		Digitoxin - integrated peak area of digitoxin, internal standard added to samples at a known concentration of 0.15 mg/mL
		0.487 - integrated peak area of compound with a retention time of 0.487 minutes. All remaining columns use this naming convention.
4. marianas_leaf_cardenolides.csv : data matrix of cardenolide peaks for milkweed leaf tissue collected in the field as part of experiment 2. Columns include:
		Sample - sample ID
		species - milkweed species
		location - island of collection
		pk11 - integrated peak area of compound with a retention time equivalent to 11% of that for digitoxin. All remaining columns use this naming convention.
		Total - cumulative peak area, expressed in mg cardenolide per g of dried tissue
5. marianas_wing_cardenolides.csv : data matrix of cardenolide peaks for monarch wing tissue collected in the field as part of experiment 2. Columns include:
		Index - sample ID
		Site - island of collection
		wingmass - mass of dried tissue, in mg
		pk6 - integrated peak area of compound with a retention time equivalent to 6% of that for digitoxin. All remaining columns use this naming convention.
		Total - cumulative peak area, expressed in mg cardenolide per g of dried tissue
		sex - butterfly sex
6. tissue_mass.csv : contains dry mass of tissue used for cardenolide measurement. Columns include:
		Sample - sample ID
		Tissue - leaf or wing
		Species - milkweed species of interest
		Mass - mass of dried tissue, in mg


The scripts directory contains four R scripts that were used for all data analysis and figure/table generation. Those scripts are:
1. cardenolide_chromatograms.R : Script for plotting raw data from cardenolide readout. This script was used to produce Figure 2A and Figure S4.2. cardenolide_stats.R : Primary analysis script for statistics and most figures/tables.3. guam_cards.R : Script for processing data from Guam and Rota samples collected in 2015. This script was used to produce Figures 5B and 5C as well Figure S1.4. maps.R : Script for generating maps used in Figure 1A and Figure 5AÊAll analyses were conducted in R version 4.0.3.
